          <p><b>FIXED DEPOSIT:</b>
All Banks in India (including SBI, PNB, BoB, BoI, Canara Bank, ICICI Bank, Yes Bank etc.)  offer fixed deposits schemes with a wide range of tenures for periods from 7 days to 10 years.   These are also popularly known as FD accounts.   However, in some other countries these are known as "Term Deposits" or even called "Bond".    The term "fixed" in Fixed Deposits (FD) denotes the period of maturity or tenor. Therefore, the depositors  are supposed to continue such Fixed Deposits for the  length of time for which the depositor decides to keep the money with the bank.  However, in case of need,  the depositor can ask for closing (or breaking) the fixed deposit prematurely by paying paying a penalty (usually of 1%, but some banks either charge less or no penalty).   (Some  banks   introduced variable interest fixed deposits.  The rate of interest on such deposits  keeps on varying with the prevalent market rates i.e. it will go up if market interest rates goes and it will come down if the market rates fall.  However, such type of fixed deposits have not been popular till date).
</p> 
<p><b>CURRENT ACCOUNT:</b>
Current Accounts are basically meant for businessmen and are never used for the purpose of investment or savings.  These deposits are the most liquid deposits and there are no limits for number of transactions or the amount of transactions in a day.  Most of the current account are opened in the names of firm / company accounts.   Cheque book facility is provided and the account holder can deposit all types of the cheques and drafts in their name or endorsed in their favour by third parties.  No interest is paid by banks  on these accounts.  On the other hand, banks charges certain  service charges, on such accounts.   
</p>
<p><b>RECURRING DEPOSIT:</b>
These are popularly known as RD accounts and are special kind of Term Deposits and are suitable for people who do not have lump sum amount of savings, but are ready to save a small amount every month.    Normally, such deposits earn interest on the amount already deposited (through monthly installments) at the same rates as are applicable for Fixed Deposits / Term Deposits.   These are best if you wish to create a fund for your child's education or marriage of your daughter or buy a car without loans or save for the future.
